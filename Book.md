# Three little pigs

# Intro

A while back an elderly mother pig had *three little pigs* and she struggled to provide enough food to feed them. Once they grew up she sent them to live ob their own. 

The first little pig was so lazy that he bulit his house out of **straw**. The second pig worked a little harder however he was still lazy and decided to build his house out of **sticks**. Then hey decided to enjoy the rest of their day by singing, dancing and playing.  

The third pig worked very hard all day long and built his house with **bricks**. It was sturdy, had a chimminy, and looked like it could withstand the strongest wind.










# chapter 2 
The wolf continued down the path and he passed by the second little pigs stick house, he smelled the little pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he imagined what a tasty dinner they would make.

He knocked at the door saying: 
"*Little pigs! Little pigs! 
Let me in! Let me in!*"

The two lazy little pigs replied: 
"*No! No! No!  
Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin*"

The wolf then **huffed** and he **puffed** and **blew** down the house.
Because the big bad wolf was greedy he wasn't able to catch both of them at once. They ran off down the path and made it to the third pigs brick house.
