# Three little pigs

# Intro

A while back an elderly mother pig had *three little pigs* and she struggled to provide enough food to feed them. Once they grew up she sent them to live ob their own. 

The first little pig was so lazy that he bulit his house out of **straw**. The second pig worked a little harder however he was still lazy and decided to build his house out of **sticks**. Then hey decided to enjoy the rest of their day by singing, dancing and playing.  

The third pig worked very hard all day long and built his house with **bricks**. It was sturdy, had a chimminy, and looked like it could withstand the strongest wind.


# Chapter 1
The next day, a wolf passed by where the pigs lived, and he saw the straw house
The wolf was hungry, and the pigs smelt good, so he knocked on the door of the straw house.
The wolf said "*Little pig! Little Pig! Let me in! Let me in!*"
But the pig saw the wolf through the keyhole, 
so the pig replied "*No! No! No! Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!*"
Then the wolf said "*Then I'll **huff**, and I'll **puff**, and I'll blow your house down.*"
So he **huffed** and **puffed** and blew the straw house down. 
The wolf tried to bite the pig, but the first little pig ran away and hid with the second little pig.

## chapter 2 
The wolf continued down the path and he passed by the second little pigs stick house, he smelled the little pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he imagined what a tasty dinner they would make.

He knocked at the door saying: 
"*Little pigs! Little pigs! 
Let me in! Let me in!*"

The two lazy little pigs replied: 
"*No! No! No!  
Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin*"

The wolf then **huffed** and he **puffed** and **blew** down the house.
Because the big bad wolf was greedy he wasn't able to catch both of them at once. They ran off down the path and they headed twoards the third little pigs house.
