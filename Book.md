## Chapter 1
The next day, a wolf passed by where the pigs lived, and he saw the straw house
The wolf was hungry, and the pigs smelt good, so he knocked on the door of the straw house.
The wolf said "*Little pig! Little Pig! Let me in! Let me in!*"
But the pig saw the wolf through the keyhole, 
so the pig replied "*No! No! No! Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!*"
Then the wolf said "*Then I'll **huff**, and I'll **puff**, and I'll blow your house down.*"
So he **huffed** and **puffed** and blew the straw house down. 
The wolf tried to bite the pig, but the first little pig ran away and hid with the second little pig.
